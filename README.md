*TASK DESCRIPTION*:

Task 1: File Handling Program â€“ Detailed Description
As part of my programming practice and academic project work, I developed a File Handling Program in the C programming language. This task involved implementing key file operations such as file creation, writing, reading, and appending data to a text file. The objective was to build a strong foundation in handling file input and output (I/O) operations, which are crucial for data persistence and interaction with the operating system.

What I Did
The task required designing a menu-driven program in C that allows the user to:
Create and write to a file (overwriting existing content)
Read data from a file and display it
Append new content to an existing file without losing previous data

I began by outlining the different operations and how they relate to file modes in C: "w" for writing, "r" for reading, and "a" for appending. I used standard C file-handling functions like fopen(), fclose(), fprintf(), fscanf(), and fgetc().

To make the program user-friendly and interactive, I included a loop-based menu system in the main function. Users could choose their desired operation and input file names and content dynamically. This modular approach helped me organize the code logically and test each function independently.

Tools and Platforms Used
To complete this task successfully, I used a combination of programming tools, learning platforms, and AI assistance:
Visual Studio Code (VS Code): My preferred code editor due to its light-weight interface, syntax highlighting, and terminal integration. I used VS Code to write, edit, and execute my C code.
Google Search: I used Google extensively to understand file modes, error handling, and edge cases. It was helpful in exploring sample programs and resolving compilation errors.
YouTube: I referred to several beginner-friendly tutorials on YouTube to visualize how file handling works in C, especially when dealing with pointers and file buffers.
By integrating these resources, I was able to build a reliable, error-free program that executes essential file operations efficiently.

Programming Preferences
I chose C as the programming language because it provides low-level access to memory and direct control over file operations through the standard I/O library. C also reinforces fundamental concepts such as pointers, buffers, and stream management, which are essential for understanding system-level programming.
I preferred command-line based execution for this task to get used to terminal-based I/O, which is common in real-world environments like Linux servers and embedded systems.

Applicability of the Task
The File Handling Program has several real-world applications and academic benefits:
Student Record Management Systems: Writing and retrieving student data from files.
Log File Creation: Storing logs of system or application events.
Text Processing Tools: Basic editors, word counters, and data analyzers.
Configuration Management: Storing and modifying software configuration files.
Database Simulation: Simulating file-based databases when relational database systems are not available.

This task builds core skills necessary for careers in backend development, system programming, embedded systems, and file-based data processing tools. It also lays the foundation for more advanced topics like database connectivity, serialization, and cloud storage integration.
